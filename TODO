- she should be able to upload her own pictures and set them to each customer.
- customers should be able to set up appointments through the website - google calendar - and she be notified of the day and approve or move the appointment via her phone/website. I could make an app too if I wanted.
- customer photos will all be dumped into one folder, but using JSON - the photos will be assigned to each specific user. Their login will determine the photos that get selected for viewing.
- She on the other hand will be able to 'view all' or select 'by customer' or even by 'date'. She can always see every picture until it's manually removed.
